# TestSolr1

I created 'Homes' core and worked on it. There is directory with 'homes' name. You have to move this directory to solr Home.

There is data file in UploadedCSVFiles which will be loaded and data will be index automatically as Default page will be loaded. 
I am loading and indexing data on Default.aspx page_load but it should move to Global.asax's Application Start method on production.


I tried stemming feature and you can try  with keywords like engineer, Engineer, Enginer, Dante, Townhouse.
